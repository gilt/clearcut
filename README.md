## Provisions

Clearcut provides several enhancements over the standard console;

- Multiple "channels" for logging, each with their own options.
- Separate vocal states for channels; on or off.
- The ability to force a channel to be vocal.
- An accessible log history.
- Fallbacks for browsers that don't support string replacement or styles in the
  console.
- Automatical line prefixing.
